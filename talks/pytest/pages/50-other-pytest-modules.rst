Useful Info
===========

If you are using `nosetests <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ It
hasn't been maintained since 2016. You need to switch before python 3.9.
This version of python will break nose by moving collection.abc stuff.

If you choose not to switch to Pytest, here are some options:

* `Nose2 <https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2>`_
* `Ward <https://github.com/darrenburns/ward>`_
* `PTR <https://github.com/facebookincubator/ptr>`_
* `UnitTest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-discovery>`_
